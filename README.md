# __<a name="solution">Solution</a>__

This solution was developed to help Azure Administrators to automate the mainatence process of AVD Environments where is required to recreate the session hosts due a image change or even for a quick deployment in another region or azure. You can learn more about this project in [post](https://techf.cloud) on my blog.

This automation may help you with:

- Creates a deployment pattern to your session hosts.
- Keep the AVD Organization Unity Clean.
- Grant Resources Tagging.
 
The diagram below helps you to have a better understandment of how the automation works and which componentes are used on Azure and Azure DevOps.

<img src="solutionDiagram.png" alt="project Diagram">

The whole automation is executed in a pipeline that runs 6 powershell scripts, that are responsible to:

- Notify Active Users.
- Remove Session Hosts from the hostpool.
- Delete the old VM's.
- Delete the ADDS computer accounts.
- Create the new session hosts.
- (Optional) Configure the the VM's to report to a specific Log Analytics workspace in case the usage of the insights feature.

# __<a name="descriptionOfTheComponents">Description of the Components</a>__

## __<a name="azureDevOps">Azure DevOps</a>__
---
### __<a name="pipeline">Pipelines</a>__
---
The automation steps are executed via Azure DevOps Pipelines, this pipeline can be configured to be executed acording to your business requirement, below you may find some examples.

You can combine scheduled and event-based triggers in your pipelines, for example to validate the build every time a push is made (CI trigger), when a pull request is made (PR trigger), and a nightly build (Scheduled trigger). If you want to build your pipeline only on a schedule, and not in response to event-based triggers, ensure that your pipeline doesn't have any other triggers enabled. For example, YAML pipelines in a GitHub repository have CI triggers and PR triggers enabled by default. For information on disabling default triggers, see Triggers in Azure Pipelines and navigate to the section that covers your repository type.

1. Manual.

After create the pipeline, you'll need to trigger it manually from the Azure DevOps Portal.

```yml
    name: "Deploying Azure Virtual Desktop Session Host"
    trigger: none
    jobs: 
    - job: Deployment
      displayName: devOpsTask - Auto Task

```

2. Schedulled Trigger.

You can use cron tab to schedule the automation execution.

Scheduled triggers configure a pipeline to run on a schedule defined using [cron syntax.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#cron-syntax)


```yml
schedules:
- cron: string # cron syntax defining a schedule
  displayName: string # friendly name given to a specific schedule
  branches:
    include: [ string ] # which branches the schedule applies to
    exclude: [ string ] # which branches to exclude from the schedule
  always: boolean # whether to always run the pipeline or only if there have been source code changes since the last successful scheduled run. The default is false.
```
3. Branch Trigger

When specifying a branch, tag, or path, you may use an exact name or a wildcard. Wildcards patterns allow * to match zero or more characters and ? to match a single character.

- If you start your pattern with * in a YAML pipeline, you must wrap the pattern in quotes, like "*-releases".
- For branches and tags:
    - A wildcard may appear anywhere in the pattern.
- For paths:
    - In Azure DevOps Server 2022 and higher, including Azure DevOps Services, a wildcard may appear anywhere within a path pattern and you may use * or ?.
    - In Azure DevOps Server 2020 and lower, you may include * as the final character, but it doesn't do anything differently from specifying the directory name by itself. You may not include * in the middle of a path filter, and you may not use ?.

```yml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - releases/*
    - feature/*
    exclude:
    - releases/old*
    - feature/*-working
  paths:
    include:
    - docs/*.md
```

### __<a name="serviceConnect">Service Connect</a>__
---

This automation requires the usage of a service connection to execute the pipeline and succefully perform the required tasks on Azure. 

Your Microsoft Azure subscription: Create a service connection with your Microsoft Azure subscription and use the name of the service connection in an Azure Web Site Deployment task in a release pipeline.

To create a service connection you can refer to this [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#create-a-service-connection).


### __<a name="selfHostedAgent">Self-Host Agent</a>__
---

The pipeline needs to be executed from a self-host agent that communicates with the domain controllers of the domain where the session hosts are joined.

Requirements:

- [Powershell core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3)
- [Az Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-9.3.0)

The [userNotification.ps1](https://github.com/frestevao/avd-sessionhost-automation/blob/4baa71d5ee1db64a08e768bcfb8e6315b2b04a93/powershellAutomations/userNotification/userNotification.ps1) is responsible to check if the available session hosts contains any active session and, if the session state is equal __"Active"__, the script sends a notification to the user desktop warning them that the environment will unavailable for a couple of minutes. It also allows the user to end their pending tasks (by default, the script waits 5 minutes)

The message is tottaly customized and you can change it in the variable ```$messageBody```, below you find the parameters used.

```pwsh 
#AVD user notification section
Write-Host (Get-Date -Format 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss').ToString() " = [WARNING] The user Session is active!"
Write-Host (Get-Date -Format 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss').ToString() " = [WARNING] Sending an alert to the user"

logState -state "WARNING" -logMessage "Sending notification to the active users"

#Generating user details variables

$userName = $activeSession.ActiveDirectoryUserName.Split('\')[1]                    
Write-Host (Get-Date -Format 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss').ToString() " = [INFO] logged user name" $userName 
logState -state "INFO" -logMessage "Logged user name: " $userName  $logFileName

#Message Section
[string]$messageTitle = "ALERT! Server Mainatence"
[string]$messageBody = "Dear user, " + $userName + " Your session Will be deactivated in 5   minutes, please save your work"

#Sending message to the user

try
  {
    $null = Send-AzWvdUserSessionMessage  `
                                        -ResourceGroupName $avdResourceGroupName `

      logState -state "INFO" -logMessage "Alert sent!" 
  }
  catch
  {
    #Calling logging function
    powershellLogging -codeSection "Sending message to the user"
  }

```

```pwsh
#Execution example

./avdUserNotification.ps1   -avdHostPoolName <hostPoolName> `
                            -avdResourceGroupName <avdResourceGroupName> `
                            -avdSubscriptionName <avdSubscriptionName or SubscriptionId>
